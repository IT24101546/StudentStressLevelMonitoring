# Student_Stress_Level_Monitoring_System
To build a Machine learning Supervised prediction system to monitor Stress level of Student.

# Student Stress Level Monitoring

# Overview
For our project we are using a Supervised Multi Classification Algorithm.
The **Student Stress Level Monitoring** project is an AI/ML-based application that predicts the stress level of students. The system classifies stress into three categories:  

- **0** – Low Stress  
- **1** – Moderate Stress  
- **2** – High Stress  

This project aims to provide early indicators of stress among students so that timely interventions can be implemented to improve their mental well-being. The model leverages machine learning algorithms trained on relevant student data to accurately predict stress levels.

## Dataset Details
The dataset used for this project contains information collected from students regarding various aspects of their academic and personal life. The features include, 
FEATURES:

Psychological: anxiety, self-esteem, mental,health, depression.
Physical: headache, blood pressure, breathing rate, sleep quality.
Environmental: noise level, living conditions, safety.
Academic: academic pressure, study load,teacher-student relationship.
Social: future career concerns, social support,peer pressure, extracurriculars, bullying.


The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize data, and encode categorical features as required for model training. The target variable is `stress_level`, represented as:  
- `0` → Low stress  
- `1` → Moderate stress  
- `2` → High stress  


In this step we have to Pre-Process the Dataset. We chose the below Data Pre Processing techniques in order to perform this. 

1.Data Cleaning- Including Handling Null values and Removing Duplicates /IT24101629
2.Removing Outiliers /IT24101571
3.Normalization /IT24103987
4.Feature Creation /IT24101618
5.Feature Selection /IT24101546
6.Dimentional Reduction(PCA) /IT24101574
